# nca_inference

Repository for training Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) models based on spatio-temporal snapshots of system behaviour. 

The code consists of three main modules: the `utils` module contains functions for visualisation and processing data, the `nca` module contains the implementations of the NCA models, and the `train` module contains the implementations of the training strategies. The `simulations` module contains the implementations of the BZ reaction and Conway's Game of Life.
